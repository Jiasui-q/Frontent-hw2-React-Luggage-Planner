      <h2 id="Collaboration">Collaboration policy</h2>

      <p>
        Programming assignments should be your own. You are not allowed to copy
        other students code, or copy/modify large chunks of code or entire
        projects found online (e.g. on GitHub).
      </p>

      <p>
        You are allowed to consult online resources, e.g. Stack Overflow, to get
        answers to specific implementation questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        LLM-based tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are helpful and
        increasingly common in industry, and
        <strong>you may use them</strong> to help you complete assignments, with
        the following caveats:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You should stick to using AI for line- or function-level edits; do
          <strong>not</strong> paste the entire chunks of the assignment
          description into ChatGPT (it’s pretty obvious when you do this).
          Programming assignments are not quite like real-world software
          development, because we often provide detail in the specification that
          would not normally be written out for you in a real-world project. If
          you use these tools, you should practice the skill of communicating
          with the tools rather than letting the assignment document do this for
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          We generally describe what we want you to learn from a particular
          exercise. Work through each task with the intention of
          <strong>practicing the skills we mention</strong>; if AI helped you
          get unstuck, do your best to come away with an understanding of the
          concepts targeted by the assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we ask you to think about the design and aesthetics of your
          application,
          <strong>we’re looking for <em>your</em> creative spark</strong>. AI
          can be great for helping you find the right CSS rules to style an
          element, but you should be making your own high-level decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of these assignments is to develop your skills to work
          independently on code implementations. LLMs can be part of this
          process, but when you prompt AI tools to help you write assignment
          code,
          <strong>you should not share the exact prompts you used</strong> with
          other students. This has a similar effect as sharing code, since it
          prevents other students from developing their own skills with the
          tools they are using. Of course, it's always okay to exchange
          high-level advice with your peers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Starter_code">Starter code</h2>

      <p>
        This assignment includes starter code in the
        <code>code</code> directory. You should build on top of this code for
        your assignment submission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do <strong>not</strong> fork the repository on GitHub or upload
        your code anywhere public-facing. Remember, students aren’t allowed to
        directly copy each other’s code for these assignments; if another
        student copies your code, we won’t be able to tell who copied whom, and
        you’ll be on the hook for the plagiarism too!
      </p>

      <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>

      <p>
        You will modify the starter code provided to you with the assignment,
        then submit your code as a zip file to Gradescope containing your code
        submission. Gradescope will give you a link to an uploaded build of your
        submission;
        <strong>you should verify that this works as expected</strong>. This
        assignment will be manually graded by course staff after the submission
        deadline.
      </p>

      <p>Submission file structure:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>submission.zip</li>
        <ul>
          <li>src/</li>
          <ul>
            <li>(...)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>public/</li>
          <ul>
            <li>(...)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>index.html</li>
          <li>package.json and package-lock.json</li>
          <ul>
            <!-- TODO: check this works -->
            <li>
              (optional. If you install new libraries, you’ll need to copy these
              files into your submission folder from outside the
              <code>code</code> folder.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Development_environment">Development environment</h2>

      <p>
        Read the assignment's README.md for instructions on how to run the local
        server; if you've done it right, the URL of this specification document
        you're reading should be http://localhost:6160/specification/index.html.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll also want to open the <code>code</code> directory of the
        repository in a text editor. We like
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="Grading">Grading</h2>

      <p>
        There are <strong>no autograded portions</strong> for this assignment;
        course staff will manually grade your work by using your Web interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should go through the assignment’s requirements checklist and make
        sure you have completed everything asked of you before submitting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the assignment is manually graded, it is important to have the
        right submission activated in Gradescope when the deadline passes. We
        will only grade your assignment once!

        <h2>Part 0 · Getting situated</h2>

        <p>
          Hello! This project will be different than your other programming
          assignments. We’ve provided a skeleton React application, which you’ll
          modify over the next few parts of the assignment. Rather than building
          to an exact, autogradable specification, you’ll design and construct
          your own interactions that implement the requested requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll build a <strong>travel planning application</strong>, which
          helps users plan their luggage for a flight, ensuring they stay within
          airline baggage weight limits.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll find the
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >React documentation</a
          >
          to be very helpful here! Be cautious about using LLMs in this
          assignment, since asking them to generate code can make it harder for
          you to understand the concepts that this homework is designed to
          teach. You’ll want to make sure you’re well-prepared for your final
          project!
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s okay if you’re finding that you don’t already know, before
          starting, everything you need to know to complete the assignment.
          Practice is the best way to become proficient!
        </p>

        <h3>Developing the application</h3>

        <p>
          If you’re running the server for this homework correctly (with
          <code>npm start</code>), you’ll be running a
          <a href="https://vite.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Vite server</a
          >
          locally on your computer. Vite automatically reloads your code as you
          save changes to the code files, which is great for fast prototyping!
          This can (rarely) cause the page to misbehave, so you may want to
          reload every now and then to make sure your code works as expected.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll be able to view your project, throughout the assignment, at
          <a
            href="http://localhost:6160/code/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >http://localhost:6160/code/</a
          >. When you submit your work, the Gradescope submission will
          <a
            href="https://vite.dev/guide/build"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >build a static version</a
          >
          of your application, which is what course staff will see when they
          grade your submission. This static build can run even without a
          dynamic Web server like the Vite server you’re using to develop your
          code; it’s what you would upload if, say, you wanted your React
          application to work on a static site host like GitHub Pages.
        </p>

        <h3>React developer tools</h3>

        <p>
          Because React encourages you to break your page up into a component
          hierarchy (similar to the HTML document tree), React provides
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >custom browser extensions</a
          >
          that augment your browser’s built-in developer tools. We recommend
          trying them out!
        </p>

        <h3>Making a change</h3>

        <p>Let’s try making a change to the code!</p>

        <p>
          <code>src/App.jsx</code> contains the entrypoint React component; it
          includes a Sidebar component and a main content area. The main content
          area renders only one of the components in the
          <code>pages</code> folder, depending on what page the user is
          currently visiting.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also have an <code>index.css</code> file (imported in
          <code>App.jsx</code>) that we’re using to store all of our
          application’s CSS. Opinions vary on exactly how to manage CSS code in
          a large project, but ours is small enough that it shouldn’t get too
          confusing to put all of our CSS in this file.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Try changing the background color of the sidebar</strong> in
          the <code>index.css</code> file. Watch the page update in real time
          (thanks to Vite’s auto reload)!
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, head into <code>Sidebar.jsx</code> (which is a
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >component</a
          >
          used by <code>App.jsx</code>, our entrypoint) and
          <strong>
            add something at the top of the sidebar, above the navigation
            links</strong
          >. Maybe you’ll add a logo or a title for the app.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll notice that the sidebar component looks a lot like HTML code.
          We’re writing
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >JSX</a
          >
          to describe our UI. There are a few differences from HTML, but it’s
          very similar here! We’ll want to add something within the
          <code>div</code> for the sidebar, but outside the <code>ul</code> tag.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Resources</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML"
              >Structuring the web with HTML - Learn web development | MDN</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul> -->
      </section>

      <section id="Part_1">
        <h2>Part 1 · Reusable components</h2>

        <p>
          There are two big reasons to use components in React. The first is to
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/understanding-your-ui-as-a-tree"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >break up your application’s code into a hierarchy</a
          >; we did this in the Sidebar component, to avoid having to clutter
          the <code>App.jsx</code> file with all of the sidebar’s content.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other is to create reusable UI elements so that you don’t need to
          rewrite the same HTML structure over and over.
        </p>

        <p>
          Peek into <code>src/luggage-overview/LuggageOverview.jsx</code>. This
          is the code for the landing page of the application; it describes the
          different sizes of luggage bag that users are allowed to bring onto a
          flight. This page isn’t dynamic, and we won’t add any interactivity to
          it for now; it’s just informational.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/luggage-types.png"
            alt="A screenshot of the landing page of the application."
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          It’s not very beautiful! You should
          <strong
            >think about how we might structure and style the markup</strong
          >
          so that it looks better; maybe the icon could be bigger or in a
          different spot. Maybe we can render the maximum weight in a way that
          stands out better. Make some design choices! In particular, you should
          choose a design that renders each luggage type more or less the same
          way (but with different content); the motivation for this will come up
          in a moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you change the markup, you’ll notice that you have to change it in
          more than one spot to keep the luggage types consistent. Rather than
          repeating the same markup over and over, let’s extract this into a
          <a

            >reusable React component</a
          >!
        </p>

        <p>
          Make a new function (either in the same
          <code>LuggageOverview.jsx</code> file, or in a new file that you
          import) that renders a single luggage type. The function should be a
          React component, meaning:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Its name should start with a capital letter</li>
          <li>
            It should take in, as its first argument, the
            <a href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component"
              ><code>props</code></a
            >
            of the component
          </li>
          <li>
            It should return the JSX markup representing the HTML structure we
            want to render
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Then, replace the individual luggage type sections in
          <code>LuggageOverview.jsx</code> with instances of your new component.
          It might look something like this:
        </p>

        <pre style="margin-left: 2rem"><code>&lt;LuggageType
  name={LUGGAGE_TYPES[0].name}
  ...
/&gt;
&lt;LuggageType
  name={LUGGAGE_TYPES[1].name}
  ...
/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          Now, you’re free to customize the structure and style of the
          component, and every change you make will affect both instances at
          once! Play around with the design until you’re happy with it.
        </p>

        <h3>Rendering lists</h3>

        <p>
          Let’s reap the benefits of having a reusable component.
          <strong>Add a new luggage type</strong> to the
          <code>LUGGAGE_TYPES</code> array (maybe we‘ll make it the
          <strong>first</strong> element of the new array, to keep it in order
          of weight):
        </p>

        <pre style="margin-left: 2rem"><code>{
  icon: "🎒",
  name: "Personal item",
  maxWeightLbs: 15,
  description: "A small bag that fits under the seat in front of you.",
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          If you’d like, you can add a new copy of the component you made
          earlier to the page, to see if this worked. But rather than manually
          hard-coding every component, it’d be better to iterate over the
          <code>LUGGAGE_TYPES</code> array, automatically making a new component
          instance for each luggage type. Then, future updates to the array
          would automatically be reflected in the UI.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Render the list of luggage types</strong> dynamically, using
          the full <code>LUGGAGE_TYPES</code> array. The
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >React docs show you how to do this</a
          >
          in detail, but the simple principle is: include a component in the
          markup for each element of the array, and don’t forget the
          <code>key</code> prop! You don’t need to use a list HTML element
          (<code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code>); the docs show this as an
          example, but you can render arbitrary dynamic element trees using this
          approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is that your main component rendering code won’t need to
          change at all if you want to add, remove, or reorder luggage types;
          only the <code>LUGGAGE_TYPES</code> array needs to be updated.
        </p>

        <h3>Checklist</h3>

        </ul>

      <section id="Part_2">
        <h2>Part 2 · Adding interactivity</h2>

        <p>
          Not all luggage is allowed for every plane ticket. In our airline’s
          “Basic Economy” fare class, only a personal item and a carry-on bag
          are allowed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s add an option to the page that lets the user select whether they
          are on a Basic Economy fare, and if so, do not show the option for
          checked luggage.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll start out with a simple design for this feature, a button that,
          when clicked, toggles whether the user is on a Basic Economy fare or a
          normal (full-featured) fare.
        </p>

        <p>
          In HTML, we can use the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag to make a
          clickable, interactable button:
        </p>

        <pre
          style="margin-left: 2rem"
        ><code>&lt;button&gt;Toggle Basic Economy&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          If you add this to your page, it won’t do anything yet, but it’ll look
          something like this:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 2rem">
          <button>Toggle Basic Economy</button>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now, how do we make it so that clicking this button can control the
          displayed luggage types?
        </p>

        <p>
          In React, we can attach <strong>program state</strong> to a component,
          ensuring that the state value is remembered even as the component
          re-renders. We do this with the <code>useState</code> function, which
          we’re already using in <code>App.jsx</code> to decide which page to
          render.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have a look at
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >React’s documentation about useState</a
          >, especially the examples!
        </p>

        <p>
          With <code>useState</code>, add a Boolean state variable
          (<code>basicEconomy</code>) to the
          <code>LuggageOverview</code> component. Don’t forget to import the
          <code>useState</code> function (you can see how this is done in
          <code>App.jsx</code>, or see if you can get your IDE to help you
          import the function automatically).
        </p>

        <p>
          Add a button, too, so that when the user clicks the button, the
          <code>basicEconomy</code> state variable toggles: if it was
          <code>true</code>, it becomes <code>false</code>, and vice versa. In
          React, you can add a click handler to a button using the
          <code>onClick</code> prop; the examples in the documentation do this a
          lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, use the value of the <code>basicEconomy</code> state variable to
          decide whether to render the checked luggage option.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the last part, we made a reusable component to render a luggage
          type, and then rendered the list so that we don’t have to write
          separate code for each luggage type. This is a good pattern, but now
          we need a way to distinguish the checked luggage type from the others.
          You might do this by adding a new field to the luggage type objects in
          the <code>LUGGAGE_TYPES</code> array, something like
          <code>allowedInBasicEconomy</code>:
        </p>

        <pre style="margin-left: 2rem"><code>[..., {
  ...
  name: "Carry-on",
  allowedInBasicEconomy: true,
  ...
},
{
  ...
  name: "Checked bag",
  allowedInBasicEconomy: false,
  ...
}]</code></pre>

        <p>
          Then, based on the state variable, you can choose whether or not to
          render luggage types that have <code>allowedInBasicEconomy</code> set
          to <code>false</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can do this either by filtering the array (so that you only render
          the relevant components in the first place) or by returning
          <code>null</code> (rather than HTML markup) from components that
          shouldn’t appear on the page.
        </p>

        <p>Check that this button works correctly before moving on:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <video controls muted loop autoplay style="max-width: 700px">
            <source src="images/basic-economy.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>

        <p>What’s the problem here?</p>

        <p>
          The state isn‘t visible to the user! Although the interactivity works,
          it’s not clear whether Basic Economy is currently active or not.
        </p>

        <p>One thing we could do is actively render the state into the page:</p>

        <pre
          style="margin-left: 2rem"
        ><code>let buttonText = "Toggle Basic Economy";
if (basicEconomy) {
  buttonText += ' (currently ON)';
} else {
  buttonText += ' (currently OFF)';
}

...

&lt;button onClick={...}&gt;
  {buttonText}
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>This works!</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <video controls muted loop autoplay style="max-width: 700px">
            <source src="images/basic-economy-2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>

        <p>
          But we’re reinventing the wheel a bit here... aren’t there already
          well-designed togglable components that communicate their current
          state?
        </p>

        <h3>Controlled components</h3>

        <p>
          This really ought to be a <strong>checkbox</strong>. HTML offers a
          checkbox element, a variant of the <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>

        <pre
          style="margin-left: 2rem"
        ><code>&lt;label&gt;Basic economy: &lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          (including a <code>label</code> ensures that the browser knows that
          this text is associated with the form control, which is great for
          accessibility; it will also make it so that clicking on the text
          toggles the checkbox. See below:)
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 2rem">
          <label>Basic economy: <input type="checkbox" /></label>
        </div>

        <p>
          If you add this to your page, you’ll see the checkbox. It will even be
          interactive, without you needing to write any code! But it won’t
          control (or reflect the value of) our state variable.
        </p>

        <p>
          In React, we control <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> elements the same
          way we just controlled our button, by rendering the current state and
          then accepting interactions that update the state.
        </p>

        <p>
          The checkbox component takes a <code>checked</code> prop, which
          decides whether the checkbox shows as being checked. If you set this
          to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, the checkbox will actually
          <em>stop</em> being interactive (since React is forcing its value to
          whatever the <code>checked</code> prop is set to).
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 2rem">
          <!-- this is not React! just good, ol'-fashioned inline javascript. -->
          <label
            >Basic economy:
            <input type="checkbox" checked onchange="this.checked = true;"
          /></label>
        </div>

        <p>
          To make the checkbox interactive again, we need to
          <strong>use the state variable</strong> as the value for the
          <code>checked</code> prop. Then, we should update our state variable
          (<code>basicEconomy</code>) when the box is checked or unchecked. We
          can do this with an onChange handler, as
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#my-checkbox-doesnt-update-when-i-click-on-it"
            >shown here in the React docs</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if we change the state variable for some other reason (say, the
          user chose some other option that is incompatible with Basic Economy,
          so we set the state variable to
          <code>false</code>
          ), this technique will update the checkbox whenever the state changes.
          The change doesn’t only need to come from the user clicking the box.
        </p>

        <p>
          A component that works like this — routing state <em>through</em> a
          state variable — is called a <strong>controlled component</strong>,
          since React is in charge of what state to render, as well as updating
          it when the user interacts with the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Add this working checkbox to your page</strong>, and remove
          the button you made earlier.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <video controls muted loop autoplay style="max-width: 700px">
            <source src="images/basic-economy-3.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>

        <p>
          You’re encouraged to try a more interesting design than a checkbox in
          your final submission — a drop-down box? a set of tabs? a toggle
          switch? — but the checkbox design (as long as it’s clear and
          aesthetically appealing!) is acceptable here.
        </p>

        <h3>Checklist</h3>

            Added a Boolean state variable (<code>basicEconomy</code>) to the

            <code>useState</code> function
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a checkbox (or other togglable UI element) that controls the

          <li>
            Used the value of the <code>basicEconomy</code> state variable to
            decide whether to render the checked luggage option (likely by

            field)

        <h2>Part 3 · Luggage planning</h2>

        <p>
          Let’s create a more interesting interactive page, one that provides
          some value to the user. On the second page (the “Planner”), we’ll give
          the user the ability to plan out what’s going to go in each of two
          bags: a personal item, and a carry-on.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <video controls muted loop autoplay style="max-width: 700px">
            <source src="images/planner.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>

        <p>
          To keep it simple, we’ll hard-code the application so that it assumes
          the user just has one of each of these bags.
        </p>

        <p>
          Implement this application in <code>Planner.jsx</code>. It should have
          the following features and implementation details:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Users can add items to either bag, specifying the name and weight
            (in pounds) of items as they are added.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use text fields for data entry (<strong>not</strong>
              <code>window.prompt</code>, which is a convenient but limited way
              to get user input)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prevent</strong> users from adding items (<em>e.g.,</em>
              by disabling the button(s)) if the “name” field is empty or the
              weight is negative
            </li>
            <li>
              After successfully adding an item, <strong>clear</strong> the
              input fields
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Show users the items they have added so far in each bag</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Use a React component</strong> to render each item, like
              we did in Part 1
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Let users delete items they have added</li>
          <li>Calculate and show the total weight of each bag</li>
          <li>Show a warning if the weight of a bag exceeds its limit</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can hard-code a limit of 15 lb for the personal item, and 22
              lb for the carry-on
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You’re welcome to add additional features or interactions as you see
          fit! <strong>Make your application beautiful, too</strong>! If you add
          anything especially fancy, please explain it with instructions in the
          page so we know how to use your application.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some tips we think will help you implement this part:</p>

        <h3>Controlled text fields</h3>

        <p>
          You can use text fields to get user input. The HTML tag for a text
          field is another variant of the <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>

        <pre
          style="margin-left: 2rem"
        ><code>&lt;input type="text" /&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          You can also use <code>type="number"</code> to get a numeric input
          field! As with checkboxes, we need to
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#my-text-input-doesnt-update-when-i-type-into-it"
            >control these inputs</a
          >
          so that we can use their values.
        </p>

        <h3>Arrays in state variables</h3>

        <p>
          Placing arrays in state can be trickier than simpler values like
          Booleans, numbers, and strings. This is because, to call the state
          update function (the second value returned by <code>useState</code>),
          you need to provide a <em>new</em> array representing the changed
          value.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s important not to change the existing state array directly (<em
            >e.g.,</em
          >
          by using the <code>push</code> function). React expects state values
          to be
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#why-immutability-is-important"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >immutable</a
          >, so you can only update the state value by creating a new array with
          your requested changes and replacing the old array entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s lots of detail on how to do this in
          <a

        <h3>Making a delete button</h3>

        <p>
          You might find that you have some trouble making a “Delete” button
          within a component. When it’s clicked, the button should update the
          state array in the <em>parent</em> component, removing that item from
          the state array.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have direct access to the parent’s state in a child.
          Instead, in the code for the <code>Planner</code> component, you’ll
          need to provide the <code>Item</code> component (or whatever you call
          it) with a <em>function</em> that can be used to delete that item.
        </p>

        <p>

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >This page</a
          >
          of the React documentation offers a lot of detail, through a worked
          example.
        </p>

        <h3>Disabling buttons</h3>

        <p>
          You can disable a button by adding the <code>disabled</code> prop to
          it. If you set this prop to <code>true</code>, the button will be
          disabled; if you set it to <code>false</code>, it will be enabled. Use
          a JavaScript expression (in {curly braces}) to decide, based on the
          program state, whether the button should be enabled or disabled.
        </p>

        <h3>Checklist</h3>

        <p>
          See above. Make sure to verify that you’ve implemented each bullet
          point!

        <h2>Part 4 · Adding a new page</h2>

        <p>
          Finally, edit <code>App.jsx</code> and <code>Sidebar.jsx</code> to add
          a <strong>new page</strong> to the application. This page should be
          called “Summary” or something similar.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Summary page is only required to contain one piece of information:
          <strong
            >the total weight of all items added in the Planner
            application</strong
          >, across all bags. You are welcome to show additional insights to the
          user!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you added one or more state variables in the Planner to track the
          items in each bag, you’ll notice that
          <strong>navigating to another page clears the state entirely</strong>,
          and you certainly won’t have access to that state variable in the
          Summary page. Both Planner and Summary are children of the App
          component, but they can't directly share state between one another.
        </p>

        <p>How do we fix this?</p>

        <p>
          The answer is to <strong>lift state up</strong>: put the luggage state
          variable into the App component instead, and give access to it in both
          Planner and Summary. The
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#lifting-state-up-by-example"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >React documentation</a
          >
          offers some guidance. You’ll need to make sure you can still
          <strong>update the program state</strong> from the Planner page! This
          will likely involve passing a function into the props of
          <code>&lt;Planner&gt;</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this is starting to feel like a lot of props being passed back and
          forth, consider using
          <a
            href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context"

            >Context</a

          application!

        <p>
          Using React Context here is optional, but if you choose to use it, you
          can earn some credit for it in Part 5 of this assignment.

          Grading for this assignment, scored out of 40 points, includes
          <strong>30 points for functionality</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To earn the remaining 10 points, you must
          <strong>improve the aesthetics of your application</strong>. You can
          also earn points by <strong>implementing extra features</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>New features</h3>

        <p>Here’s a list of features we will award points for:</p>

        <strong>1 point each</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add a “quantity” field so that users can specify how many of a
            particular item to add
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the ability to save and load bags from local storage, so that
            the program state is not lost when the page reloads
          </li>
          <li>Make the sidebar show the currently-selected page</li>
          <li>
            Use React Context (or a state management library like Zustand) to
            manage state across components
          </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>2 points each</strong>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Allow users to add multiple bags of each type, rather than just one
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow users to reorder items within a bag, or move items between
            bags
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Consider using a “sortable list” library, so that items can be
              dragged around to reorder
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Add inline editing features so that users can change the name or
            weight of an item without deleting and re-adding it
          </li>
          <li>
            Use React Router or another technique to show different URLs in the
            browser URL bar depending on the selected page
          </li>
          <li>
            Add more insights to the Summary page, with some kind of useful
            visual — consider using a library like Plotly or Chart.js!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You can earn <strong>up to 6 points</strong> for adding extra
          features.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you add new functionality, <strong>be explicit</strong> about what
          new features you added. Include some text in the page that describes
          everything you improved, so we know what to look for!
        </p>

        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>

        <p>
          You should also improve the aesthetics of your application, worth up
          to 10 points. You are required to do this to earn full credit, and you
          can earn full credit on the assignment even without implementing
          additional functionality. We’ll expect really exceptional work,
          though, if you want to earn all 10 points for aesthetics.
        </p>

        <p>
          As in prior assignments, we tend to be most impressed when you
          <strong>stick to a consistent theme</strong>, and it should be more
          ambitious than simply “make the application look nice, clean, and
          modern.” We know what it looks like when you got an LLM to design your
          application for you, and these submissions don’t stand out. Do
          something creative!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >The maximum score you can earn on this assignment is 40/40</strong
          >. You can earn up to 10 points for improved aesthetics, and up to 6
          points for extra features, but you cannot earn more than 40 points
          total. You’re encouraged to put in some extra work so that you’ll have
          more opportunities to earn these final 10 points!
        </p>

        <h3>Custom libraries</h3>

        <p>
          You can install custom packages (like component libraries and utility
          libraries) to this project with npm. If you do, make sure to include
          <code>package.json</code> <strong>and</strong>
          <code>package-lock.json</code>, which should be updated automatically
          when you install new libraries, in your submission zip file. These
          will not be included automatically, since they reside outside of the
          <code>code/</code> folder; you’ll need to copy them in manually.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don’t include these files, the autograder will fail to build
          your project, and the TAs won’t be able to grade it!
          <strong
            >Make sure to check that the autograder uploads a working version of
            your application</strong
          >, even if you don’t install any custom libraries.
